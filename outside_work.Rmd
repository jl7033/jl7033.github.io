I never enjoyed running as a kid, but I joined my high-school cross-country team when I was 15 and haven't looked back. I'm currently trying to run a half marathon in all 50 states; as of the end of 2025, I'm at 7 so far! You can track my progress here.

My friend Emily Ham and I have been playing jazz around New York City over the past year. If you'd like to reach out, please do so by clicking the email link!
